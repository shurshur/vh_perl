Not implemented yet both in LuaScript and PerlScript:
	vh::GetTempRights
	vh::SetTempRights

Use Math::Int64 instead of double in GetTotalShareSize???

Return vh::GetNickList as array in array context??? Currently only separated *Array function implemented

Fix everytime rebuild of vh module in cmake
